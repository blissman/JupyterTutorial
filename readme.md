# Jupyter Tutorial
This repo contains machine learning exercises for Jupyter Notebook.

# Prerequisites
## Anaconda
Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) from this link, or by using homebrew:
```zsh
brew install anaconda
```
You could install python, Jupyter Notebook, etc. independently as well, but this is easier.
